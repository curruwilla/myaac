Most of them died. Many of them got mad. Several were viciously mutated and transformed. A few got away. Only a handful survived and gained knowledge that they could apply to new and powerful spells. The knowledge of this particular spell has come with massive casualties and suffering. A dedicated group of sorcerers managed to piece it together with bits and pieces that were gathered by the few survivors. Internal struggles of that group lead to the spell, that was intended to be kept as a secret between few, to be released to the public, probably in an act of spite of one of their members that felt unappreciated. Now the spell is taught buy the guild to its most experienced and supposedly most trustworthy members.",

For this reason the crafty sorcerers and druids are constantly looking for new ways to assist the Tibian heroes and to guarantee their survival. This spell was one of the more uncommon solutions they have found. Starting from the thought that to survive a battle means to live to fight another day, the researchers developed it to help adventurers to escape from fights they cannot win. Using their excellent medical and anatomical knowledge, the druids found a way to magically generate powerful adrenaline rushes which allow the caster to perform superhuman feats for short periods of time, allowing them to outrun most common creatures. It has to be said that some reckless sorcerers proposed a different approach which was actually based on the manipulation of time itself. This approach, however, was quickly dismissed by the wise council at Edron's magic academy, since it posed imponderable risks. Unfortunately, however, these studies were carried on in secrecy. Later on, they led to the creation of the more powerful, but dangerously unstable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tibia.com\/library\/?subtopic=spells&amp;spell=stronghaste\">Strong Haste<\/a> spell.",

For this reason those who have chosen the path of magic usually neglect physical exercise, training their minds rather than their bodies. As a result, spell casters are typically frail and cannot endure injuries the way skilled warriors can. However, sorcerers and druids reacted to this problem in their typical manner, looking for magical means to protect their weak bodies in battle. The Magic Shield spell was the result of this research. By casting this spell it is possible to deflect any physical or magical damage by using sheer will power. Unfortunately, however, the mental strain caused by the spell is tremendous, and any damage that is deflected by the magical shield is directly taken from the caster's mana reserve. For this reason the spell should be used wisely. While there is little point in using it against weak monsters, Magic Shield has saved the life of many a spell caster when battling strong monsters that otherwise would have killed him in a second.",

The druids, who were skilled with all kinds of poisons, wanted to help those young adventurers that were not able to cure themselves. After many years of research they finally succeeded in altering the cure poison spell so it could be bound to a rune.

When the rune is used a field of approximately one square metre is covered by searing fire that will last for some minutes, gradually diminishing as the blaze wears down. As with all field spells, Fire Field is quite useful to block narrow passageways or to create large, connected barriers. Placing the field on an opponent is also a strategy that will work well with weaker monsters, although most stronger creatures will easily shake off the effect.<br>Please note that on optional PvP game worlds this spell has no damaging effect on other characters, unless characters are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tibia.com\/gameguides\/?subtopic=manual&amp;section=guilds#guildwars\">war<\/a> opponents.",

In contrast to the single shot of a Fireball rune, the Great Fireball affects a huge area, up to 37 square metres! This way any average sized room is easily filled with the searing blaze, scorching all creatures that are in it except for the rune user himself. It stands to reason that the Great Fireball is a favourite of most Tibians, as it is well suited both to hit whole crowds of monsters and individual targets that are difficult to hit because they are fast or hard to spot. There are few adventurers who do not cherish those moments of silent glory when they have just brought down a whole crowd of enemies with a single Great Fireball. Still, due to the large blast radius the users are well advised not to be too trigger happy with this rune to make sure no friend is near when it is used.",

            "description": "<br>Druids, the traditional wardens of nature and of all that is alive, have come to master the growth of plants. This spell is one of the results of this secret knowledge. By calling upon nature, a skilled druid can charge a blank rune twice with this useful spell. By unleashing the spell, all seeds that are lying dormant in the surrounding quickly sprout and grow into full-sized plants, thus forming an impenetrable thicket. Unfortunately, plant life created this way is short-lived and will collapse within minutes, so the magically created obstacle will not last long. Still, this spell can be quite useful to block a monster you cannot hope to defeat, thus giving you valuable time to make your escape.<br>\nOn open PvP game world, wild growth can also be yellowish. The yellow tone appears to all characters who are not in a PvP situation with the casting character. Characters can simply walk through yellowish wild growth.<br>\nOn optional PvP game worlds, wild growth is mostly yellowish and will collapse if somebody walks on a field with wild growth. The only exception is wild growth cast by one of your opponents if you are involved in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tibia.com\/gameguides\/?subtopic=manual&amp;section=guilds#guildwars\">guild war<\/a>. Such plants will last just as long as on other game world types, or until somebody who is not a war opponent of the casting character walks against it.<br>\nThe sage Eremo teaches this rune spell to all druids who have shown their dedication to nature and to life by promoting to the rank of elder druid.",
