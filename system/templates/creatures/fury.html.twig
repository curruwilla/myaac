Although of deceptive beauty, the Fury is a bloodthirsty monster that knows no remorse. A Fury will not listen to logical arguments or accept surrender. Fight is everything they think about and care for. Her hands can turn into fiery claws that can shred a shield to pieces with ease and their incredible strength belies their slender and fragile stature. A Fury's hatred is so strong that it provides them with an unearthly resilience which can only be stopped by death. Literally too hot-headed to lead any sizeable force into battle, the demons employ them on missions of carnage and chaos. Even when not in combat, they tend to destroy things just for the fun of it. After all a Fury is a creature of hatred and destruction. Some demons employing the services of Furies keep them chained until the very last moment. Needless to say that this treatment drives the Fury in an even greater frenzy. Other demons enjoy to lock up prisoners in a cell with a handful of Furies and to watch the spectacle.</p>  <p>Furies have 4100 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against holy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death, earth, energy and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Furies yield 4500 experience points. They carry concentrated demonic blood, demonic essence, gold coins, great health potions, jalape√±o peppers, rusty legs, soul orbs, terra rods and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
