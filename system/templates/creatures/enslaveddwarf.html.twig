Sometimes in the ancient past they were found by 'those below' and cruelly enslaved by the masters of the depths. After generations of slavery and breeding, those dwarfs have lost all memory of their ancestry and culture, rendering them hardly more than aggressive animals of war. They lack a complicated language, communicating only with select gnarls and snarls. Their entire bitter lives are centred around battle and carnage. After their masters have completely broken their will, the Lost march in unquestioning obedience into battle whenever their cruel slavers order them to do so. It is hard to tell what motivation drives them. They seem not to revere to their masters in any way and show no joy in battle. The only emotion they are showing is incredible anger that rivals that of a rabid animal.</p>  <p>Enslaved Dwarfs have 3800 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth, energy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Enslaved Dwarfs yield 2700 experience points. They carry brown mushrooms, gold coins, iron ore, platinum coins, small amethysts, small emeralds and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
