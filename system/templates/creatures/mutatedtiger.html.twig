In most cases, the mutation is rather a by-product of another process that aims at stealing the cat's vitality and agility to produce a youth potion that is of great demand among the wealthy and powerful all over the world. Although some of the most resilient tigers survive this horrible draining-process, they  turn incurably mad and wild. In addition, these rare individuals become much more vital and stronger than they have ever been in their former lives.<br/>To the dismay of some excited alchemists, who had tried to drain those beasts to gain even more powerful potions, the vital force of Mutated Tigers is toxic. This, however, did not stop the alchemists to undertake further gruesome experiments. After surviving these cruel experiments, the beasts reached a point beyond madness and rage. They are the incarnation of pain and agony, and seem to want to spread them both as much as possible. With their increased power, it becomes more and more difficult to have them in their laboratories.<br/>Sometimes, thoughtless alchemists release the beasts into the wild, when it becomes too dangerous to keep them. Others are sold to arenas, zoos or curiosity shows. The buyer usually regrets the trade quickly - that is, if he is lucky to live long enough to regret something.<br/>Unlike to their former lives, Mutated Tigers care little for stealth and lying in ambush. They usually charge an opponent and try to overwhelm him with sheer ferocity and power. They seem  to need immense amounts of food after their mutation, still if they have the chance, they kill much more than they could possible need for survival.</p>  <p>Mutated Tigers have 1100 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth, energy, fire and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Mutated Tigers yield 750 experience points. They carry gold coins, meat, sabreteeth, striped fur and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
