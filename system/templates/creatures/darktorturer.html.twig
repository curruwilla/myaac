Like all members of the imp family, they enjoy pain and havoc they wreak upon other creatures. Their physical abilities exceed by far those of their cousins, the diabolic imps. Since they lack the magical affinity of the latter, those creatures tend to sell their services to more powerful demons or even some malicious mortals. Given their somewhat lazy and cowardly nature, they prefer to take up the roles of jailers and torturers. There they can indulge their malicious instincts without risking too much in open warfare. Those disgusting qualities have earned this race the fitting name Dark Torturer in the vernacular.</p>  <p>Dark Torturers have 7350 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth and energy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Dark Torturers yield 4650 experience points. They carry concentrated demonic blood, gold coins, great health potions, great mana potions, ham, platinum coins, soul orbs and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
