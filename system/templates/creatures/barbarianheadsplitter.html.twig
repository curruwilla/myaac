They have failed in previous battles due to their cowardice or lack of skill and are therefore deprived the honour to challenge an enemy face to face. The harsh community of the barbarians makes it easy to fall in disgrace with their leaders. Those who are deemed unworthy have to atone for their failure by becoming second line support fighters and engaging an enemy from a distance. Only if their superiors see them fight recklessly, they might return to the ranks of the true warriors. Given the fact that distance fighting is seen as dishonourable, those barbarians have a hard time to get accepted by the tribe again. Seen as dispensable, other tribesmen do little to defend the distance fighters when they become cornered. As they rely on their own and constantly feel to have to prove themselves as worthy, the Barbarian Headsplitters fight twice as hard and fierce which makes them formidable opponents despite their low rank in their society.</p>  <p>Barbarian Headsplitters have 100 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against energy, holy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and earth damage. It takes 450 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned.</p>  <p>Barbarian Headsplitters yield 85 experience points. They carry brass helmets, gold coins, knives, torches and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
