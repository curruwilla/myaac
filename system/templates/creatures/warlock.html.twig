Nobody, however, knows what their plans are, hiding deep in the dungeons of Tibia and attacking and killing every intruder of their sphere, so that hardly any information about them can permeate.Of course, Warlocks know a lot of fighting spells. They can shoot fire and energy in various forms, summon stone golems as vassals, paralyze their victims and drain mana off them. Moreover, they know how to heal themselves and how to make themselves invisible.</p>  <p>Warlocks have 3500 hitpoints. They are immune to energy, fire and ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Warlocks yield 4000 experience points. They carry cherries, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
