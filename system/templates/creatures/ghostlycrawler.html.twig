The environment of Zarganash, with is the complete antithesis to life, health and growth, immediately begins to twist and corrupt those spirits in body and mind. With alarming speed it moulds them into something far more sinister and dangerous. In a mockery of their former existence, they foster the growth of bleakness and of all things that carry the deathly taint of Zarganash. In a vague memory of their former existence they find purpose in a twisted form of the things that were once dear to them. Where they once fostered growth, they now shepherd the lost souls towards their inevitable doom and damnation. They do so without glee, though. For them they are just following a new found natural order that all things have to bow to. Where other creatures of Zarganash seem to enjoy the suffering and abandonment of hope, the branchy crawlers seemingly just gave in to their new existence with an overwhelming resignation that virtually begins to seep out of them. Though they might even be able to feel some form of pity towards their victims, they still show no remorse or restraint. If anything, they seem to experience overwhelming self-loathing. They carry with them blight and despair, eternally locking them out of everything that could have had any deeper meaning to them. They are barred of anything they once held dear. In yet another mockery of their former existence the branchy crawlers have odd regenerative abilities. Whenever they are destroyed their essence will reform into a new branchy crawler after a while. This form of immortality is yet only a curse to them, binding them eternally to the twisted form and existence that they hate. </p> <p>Branchy Crawlers have 27000 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against earth and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death, energy and fire damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Branchy Crawlers yield 17860 experience points. They carry crystal coins and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
