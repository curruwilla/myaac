Obviously a mixture of quara and sharks, they share the most disgusting and most lethal attributes of both. Ruthless and vicious they know no mercy and no surrender. Quara Predators are known to fight until the last spark of life leaves their bodies. Sometimes they even fight against each other after slaying all enemies in sight.On shore they are somewhat weaker, losing their speed and agility, but their huge jaws are still fatal.</p>  <p>Quara Predators have 2200 hitpoints. They are immune to fire and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against earth and energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Quara Predators yield 1600 experience points. They carry gold coins, quara bones and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
