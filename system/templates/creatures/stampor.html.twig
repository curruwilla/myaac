Some of them see the Stampor as holy animal of a long forgotten god. Others claim that the Stampor must be some surviving experiment of an ancient and now extinct race. Another faction sees the Stampor as an ordinary animal with a high affinity to the element earth. All of them base their theories on the Stampor's astonishing abilities which nonetheless seem rather natural and not based on magic at all. Be it as it may, the Stampors that have been encountered were quite powerful and often a threat to travellers. This is not caused by an unusual aggressiveness of the Stampor, but rather on their stupidity and bad eyesight. They seem to mistake unknown intruders as members of other Stampor herds which they try to drive off. While a Stampor is very resilient and tough and can easily withstand the 'friendly poking' and spitting, for an ordinary human such friendly warnings can become life-threatening. They seem to be drawn to places aligned to elemental earth in some way and there were sightings of Stampors in areas to which they would be physically unable to travel. Of course this only fuelled rumours and the above mentioned theories, though none of this sightings could be confirmed, yet.</p>  <p>Stampors have 1200 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, energy, fire, holy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Stampors yield 780 experience points. They carry gold coins, platinum coins, stampor talons and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
