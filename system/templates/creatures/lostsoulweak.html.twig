They are often easy prey to the unnatural predators of the nether realms that feast on them in one way or the other. When not entirely destroyed by such vicious attacks those souls are changed forever. The 'leftovers' became more of an environmental hazard than anything else. Now completely barren of thought or purpose, they roam the planes before the afterlife with a hungry unawareness. Oblivious to anything but an unnameable greed they are drawn to live like moths to a candle. Their only purpose seems to be this need to devour, without even realising what it is that they want or need. Their hungry attacks aim to the life force of anything living and come close to damaging the very soul of the target. Perhaps with more sentience and purpose the attacks of the flimsy souls could drain and devour the souls of the living and actually change the state of their victims in horrible ways. Luckily such concurrences seem to be extremely rare but this is a development that is closely monitored by those who dabble into the knowledge of the netherworlds. The flimsy souls are frighteningly common and according to knowledgeable plane travellers and spiritualists their number has grown disproportionately in modern times. Despite their mindlessness they tend to occur in small groups and sometimes even form herds that jointly seem to search for an unknown target until they finally disperse after a while. Since they are hollow and bare of anything but the most rawest and stale proto matter of the nether realms other inhabitants largely ignore them. They are often found seemingly accompanying other denizens of the underworld, however, undoubtedly they are just following random impulses and stimuli forced upon them by their dreadful existence.</p> <p>Flimsy Lost Souls have 4000 hitpoints. They are immune to death damage and cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against earth, energy and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Flimsy Lost Souls yield 4500 experience points. They carry lost souls, platinum coins and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
