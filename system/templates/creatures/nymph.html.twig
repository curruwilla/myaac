They dwell in the hills and forests of Feyrist, often near lakes and streams and they can't die of old age nor illness. On Feyrist, nymphs can be encountered by lone travelers where their music might be heard, and the traveler could spy on their dancing or bathing in a stream or pool. Such encounters could be dangerous, though, as nymphs generally dislike to be stalked. These fae have a special, strong bond to the plants and animals of their domain and are very protective of  Feyrist's flora and fauna. Nymphs emerge from mortals' dreams about love.</p>  <p>Nymphs have 900 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Nymphs yield 850 experience points. They carry colourful snail shell, dandelion seeds, fresh fruit, gold coins, wild flowers and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
