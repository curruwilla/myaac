It is disputable if this results in their weaker physical constitution or in the fact that they are simply smarter than the average dworcish male. They are the dworcs with the best knowledge and skills in brewing poison, and no Dworc Venomsniper has ever been encountered without carrying various vials filled with some toxin. Single snipers are a rare view. Usually, they hide behind the fleshhunters and hurl volleys of poisonous projectiles at their enemies from a safe distance. If they get cornered, they are easy prey since they lack the skill and weaponry to stand a serious assault on their own.</p>  <p>Dworc Venomsnipers have 80 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. Moreover, they are strong against holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death, fire and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced.</p>  <p>Dworc Venomsnipers yield 35 experience points. They carry gold coins, leather armors and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
