Those are the words associated with the Elder Wyrms by those few who have seen them and lived to tell the tale. Having clawed away all potential rivals, an Elder Wyrm has grown a darker, thick scale, and has retired to an ideal lair deep below the earth, where it basks in the heat of lava streams and feeds off interesting gems, most of the time. Some of its offspring is usually around as well, prepared to hunt or scout for its parent should it develop a special appetite. Once the younger Wyrm develops an appetite for its parent's lair, though, a savage battle for the hunting ground ensues, leaving only the winner alive.</p>  <p>Elder Wyrms have 2700 hitpoints. They are immune to energy damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth and fire damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Elder Wyrms yield 2500 experience points. They carry dragon ham, gold coins, platinum coins, strong health potions, strong mana potions, wyrm scales and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
