As a faithful hunting companion as well as a draught animal for the dog sleds, the Husky has become a vital part of the life in the North. Huskies are a prized possession and the Husky breeders are eminently respectable. The best of those dogs are nearly invaluable to their masters and even the chance to use a dog sled now and then is seen as great sign of trust and a great honour. Playful and curious, Huskies roam the streets and camps of the northmen, some are even trained as watchdogs. Huskies are almost exclusively encountered in the company of men and it's doubtful if they were able to survive on their own.</p>  <p>Huskies have 140 hitpoints. It takes 420 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Huskies yield 0 experience points. They carry nothing with them.</p>  </div></div>
