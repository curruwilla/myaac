With their magic they support the other troops in a fight. They can create energy fields and shoot fireballs or magic missiles.  As they are weak short-range fighters, guards will protect them while they operate from the second row.</p>  <p>Minotaur Mages have 155 hitpoints. They are strong against earth, energy and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Minotaur Mages yield 150 experience points. They carry carrots, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
