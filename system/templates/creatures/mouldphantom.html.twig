Spirits, soaked with decay and putrefaction, the mould phantoms are the heralds of rot. Wither is what they breathe, decay what accompanies them. They lack any true sentience, though their processing of captured souls through a disgusting version of composting, they sometimes appear to interact with their environment on purpose. This is yet only a random illusion though. The true self of the mould phantom is of a wandering zone of decay. More a natural disaster than an entity. There is some interaction between mould phantoms but this seems to follow more natural laws, shared amongst their kind and not by sentient decisions. Other such interactions are their attraction to living things. Their nature draws them to the living to spread their decay to them and share their rot. Even here they don't hurt the living on some kind of purpose but by inherent attributes of their rotten existence. They are drawn to certain places in Zarganash and though the unschooled eye see little difference in this places to other, they can be considered as Zarganash centres of decay. As such they seem to change over time, which leads to hordes of mould phantoms that migrate to new centres that they seem to sense over great distances. Such tides of mould phantoms are usually avoided by other denizens of Zarganash. Even more so, since the wandering phantoms display an otherwise unseen amount of unity in these times. If one is attacked, the attacker is quickly swarmed and usually overwhelmed by the horde, that stops its voyage until the enemy is utterly annihilated. When they reach their destination the horde quickly disperses. When a mould phantom has settled it's usually extremely territorial and does not wander off too much. That is until a new horde is formed. </p> <p>Mould Phantoms have 28000 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Mould Phantoms yield 18330 experience points. They carry crystal coins, gold ingots and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
