They rely on some strange kind of substance or drug to maintain their powers over ice and cold. Several of them serve the raider tribes with their magic, others are on missions for their sinister leader and can be encountered almost everywhere in the North. Again others became renegades and work only for their own agenda. Those renegade witches are even more hostile and dangerous. Ice Witches make use of icy variants of known spells and are schooled in the basics of shamanism and nature magic. This strange blend of sorcery and animism hints that they have been influenced by both magical schools in some way. It is speculated that a sorcerer might have tried to 'convert' shamans to the conventional ways of teachings and shared some wisdom with them.</p>  <p>Ice Witches have 650 hitpoints. They are immune to ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth, fire and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Ice Witches yield 580 experience points. They carry gold coins, ice cubes and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
