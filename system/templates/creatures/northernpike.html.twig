With a healthy dose of luck, the Northern Pike can be caught in many lakes across Tibia. Given the ability of going underwater, the adventurous explorer can also experience these frail creatures in their natural habitats. Catching them without a fishing rod, however, can be a challenging task.</p>  <p>Northern Pikes have 95 hitpoints. They are immune to earth and fire damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and physical damage. It takes 0 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Northern Pikes yield 0 experience points. They carry nothing with them.</p>  </div></div>
