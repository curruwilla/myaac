Sailors whispered of strange lights at the bottom of the sea, and of horrible maned sea serpents guarding sunken treasures, roaming the bottom of the ocean amidst long-lost shipwrecks and the ruins of an ancient city.<br/>In truth, the Seacrest Serpents much prefer to stay deep below the waves most of the time, but sometimes, Oramond sailors have reported sightings of the seacrest serpents breaking through the waves in a horrible storm, dancing to the lightning light and destroying any ship unfortunate enough to be caught up between them.<br/>Fiercely territorial and aggressive, Seacrest Serpents attack anything that looks edible or threatening. They only tolerate some of their smaller brethren and critters like jellyfish or sharks who live off their waste and pick their teeth clean for them.<br/>Not unlike dragons, seacrest serpents love things that glitter, and preferably build a nest in sunken ships or amidst a hoard of gold, in which to hatch their young. Sailors surmise that in the mating season, these giant serpents take down fully laden ships on purpose in order to attract a partner.</p>  <p>Seacrest Serpents have 3000 hitpoints. They are immune to ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth, energy, fire and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Seacrest Serpents yield 2600 experience points. They carry dragon ham, platinum coins, seacrest hair, seacrest scales and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
