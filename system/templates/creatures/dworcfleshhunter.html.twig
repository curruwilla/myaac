The name is referring to the cannibalistic habits of this disgusting race. Dworc Fleshhunters serve as scouts, and in battles they form the shock troops of the dworcish tribes. With long lance-like weapons, they try to slow down their enemies while other dworcs attack from a safe distance. Like all dworcs, the constant exposure to poison has made them immune to all toxic effects, and like all dworcs they like to apply some sort of poison on their weaponry. Without their allies their fighting abilities to delay and to distract their enemy becomes almost worthless, and so they pose only a little threat to a seasoned fighter.</p>  <p>Dworc Fleshhunters have 85 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death, fire and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced.</p>  <p>Dworc Fleshhunters yield 40 experience points. They carry gold coins, leather armors and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
