They live at the ice islands in the north-west of Tibia, where they hunt small animals. A single Winter Wolf is rather shy, but as a pride they can be quite dangerous. And when they are hungry they even attack humans.</p>  <p>Winter Wolves have 30 hitpoints. They are strong against fire, holy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and energy damage. It takes 260 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Winter Wolves yield 20 experience points. They carry meat and winter wolf fur with them.</p>  </div></div>
