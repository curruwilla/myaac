Born from dark fragments of lost souls, they are not bound to this plane, nor do they have a past. They long for a physical existence and their sole goal is to anchor themselves to our world. They are literally pure evil woven from bad spare parts of souls and feed on the life energy of any living creature. The most powerful dire spectres are the oldest. Those who clung to this plane for long enough, eventually gained adequate power to control and coordinate other spectres. Those are the most dangerous and resourceful and should be treated with the utmost care. Ripper Spectres are most dangerous at close-range. They pack a mean punch and will make you rethink the term "phantom" when engaging with any of their kind.</p> <p>Ripper Spectres have 3800 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against earth and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and fire damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Ripper Spectres yield 3500 experience points. They carry great spirit potions, platinum coins, two handed swords and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
