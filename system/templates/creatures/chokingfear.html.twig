It has no head, but loves to twist heads off. A Choking Fear will always chase after opponents, trying to get close, eager to have his long cold fingers around their necks. It enjoys the sound and feel of the dying and delights in feeling their death rattle. It is surmised that somewhere, in a dark prison cell, horrible pains and fears had been inflicted to the father of all Choking Fears, maddening him beyond belief until his rage took a ghastly form and he escaped. Any Choking Fear will always see all that breathes as its enemy, and chase them relentlessly while taunting them about their nearing end. Choking Fears love to tease and toy with their victims, prolonging their death; and they tie up their victims in their hemp ropes as a ghastly dangling trophy attached to high trees or roof beams.</p>  <p>Choking Fears have 5800 hitpoints. They are immune to earth and fire damage. Moreover, they are strong against death, energy, ice and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Choking Fears yield 4700 experience points. They carry blue crystal splinters, brown crystal splinters, dead weights, gold coins, great mana potions, great spirit potions, hemp ropes, platinum coins, ultimate health potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
