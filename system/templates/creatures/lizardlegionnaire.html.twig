Once the vast armies of the lizard people ruled the land of Zao with an iron fist. They had freed the lands from long forgotten competitors and efficiently eradicated each major threat for the empire. Each new menace was faced by the well-trained army led by elite generals. Even when the lizard people ruled unchallenged for centuries, their legions were not allowed to disregard their training. Bound to ancient traditions, their training continued under the rules set by the founders of the empire. The training has lost little of its harshness in the course of centuries.<br/>A Lizard Legionnaire is only responsible to army members of higher ranks. A position in the legion is one of prestige, and even though they are still at the mercy of their superiors, it is a step to relative freedom because a place in the army saves the Lizard Legionnaire from the influence of the many bureaucrats of the empire.<br/>For a long period in the lizard people's history, the legions were only useful for parades and guardian duties. Still, when the great plague and the rise of the lizard people's enemies threatened the empire, the legions stood ready but saw themselves heavily outnumbered. During hasty recruitments, auxiliary troops were raised from the remaining population. But even fitted out with the best equipment, those untrained troops perished by dozens. Only the restocking of the legion ranks proved effective. With the stabilisation of the empire by the might of the dragons, the legions finally got the vitally needed time to refill their ranks and slowly managed to hold the status quo on their own. Still, the empire lacks Lizard Legionnaires to regain lost territory and looks for other means to strengthen its power.</p>  <p>Lizard Legionnaires have 1400 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. Moreover, they are strong against fire damage. On the other hand, they are weak against ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Lizard Legionnaires yield 1100 experience points. They carry broken halberds, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
