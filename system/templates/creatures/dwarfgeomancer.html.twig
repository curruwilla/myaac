Dwarfs worship the powers of the elements, and the most gifted among them have managed to master the raw forces of earth and fire. Like all others of their race, Dwarf Geomancers are sturdy and strong. Instead of using the axe, they call on the power of earth to smash their enemies, hurling balls of molten rock at whoever is opposing them. Even worse, earth also confers amazing healing powers on Dwarf Geomancers, making them formidable enemies that are difficult to overcome.</p>  <p>Dwarf Geomancers have 380 hitpoints. They are strong against earth, energy, fire and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Dwarf Geomancers yield 265 experience points. They carry blank runes, gold coins, magic light wands, pears, white mushrooms and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
