Insane to a degree that resembles rabies, they are all teeth and claws when attacking an enemy. Their masters often bind their weapons to their hands, since the lost beserkers tend to forget to use them in the heat of battle and often try to overpower their foes through clawing and biting. Gnomish troops that took enemy bases by surprise told stories that the lost beserkers are held in what resembles high security prisons chained in iron, deprived from sound and vision by leathery masks. More than other Lost they are focused on battle and carnage. Even other Lost, accustomed to injuries, wars and infighting tend to avoid them. Sometimes their bloodlust is so great that they begin to fight each other even in the midst of battle.</p>  <p>Lost Berserkers have 5900 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, energy, fire, ice and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Lost Berserkers yield 4400 experience points. They carry brown mushrooms, gold coins, great health potions, great mana potions, platinum coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
