Their tall hunch is covered with small horns and a downright oversized horn is jutting out of their foreheads. Both adult males and females feature this horn, though not the newborn young. Besides fighting with it, a clomp uses its horn to scrape away mud in wallows, to pull down plants for eating, and to open paths through thick vegetation. Clomps form a variety of social groupings. Adult males are generally solitary, except for mating and fighting. Adult females are largely solitary when they are without calves. Mothers will stay close to their calves for up to four years after birth. Yet sometimes clomps congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Salt licks are very important because of the essential nutrients the clomp receives from the salt - provided it's not the toxic salt of the dried seas and rivers which cover the entire peninsula of Krailos. The clomp is herbivorous, eating diverse plant species, especially their shoots, twigs, young foliage and fallen fruit. Clomps are the largest animals in Krailos, but although they are very strong and have a reputation for being tough, they are quite easily hunted by the ogres, as the clomps visit water holes daily and can be killed while they drink. The ogres mainly hunt them for their meat and thick fur, but the large horns and bones are also used for ogre implements. </p>  <p>Clomps have 900 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Clomps yield 475 experience points. They carry raw meats and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
