It is rumoured that they are the bodies of dead adventurers that have been revived by some evil power. Cropping up in packs and occasionally accompanied by other undead creatures like ghouls, they are quite nasty opponents, particularly because they are able to drain life energy off their opponents.</p>  <p>Skeletons have 50 hitpoints. They are immune to death damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. It takes 300 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Skeletons yield 35 experience points. They carry bones, gold coins, pelvis bones, torches and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
