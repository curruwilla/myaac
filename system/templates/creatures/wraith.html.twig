Still trapped in their lust for revenge, they mindlessly attack everything they encounter. Mercy is no option and its futile to argue with these maddened ghosts. Their broken and twisted minds are constantly tormented by the ever-present memory of their gruesome death. Entrapped in their feelings and memories, they only find relief when inflicting some of those feelings on living beings. In an insane surge of joy, they attack the life force of others, feeding their pain and amplifying it by projecting their own agony and horror upon their victims. It is said that those who survived the attacks of a Betrayed Wraith are driven insane, they age before their time and turn into white-haired shadows of their former selves.</p>  <p>Betrayed Wraiths have 4200 hitpoints. They are immune to death, earth, energy and fire damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Betrayed Wraiths yield 3500 experience points. They carry assassin stars, concentrated demonic blood, demonic essence, gold coins, great mana potions, platinum coins, power bolts, small diamonds, ultimate health potions, unholy bones and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
