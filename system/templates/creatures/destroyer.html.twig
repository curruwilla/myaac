By all accounts much stronger than smart, they are particularly effective in close combat. Powerful enough to be noticed by other demons but still too weak to be of any importance, Destroyers love to torment and bully creatures that are lower in the demonic pecking order. This gets them often into fights with the smart but physically weak imps. Since both races feel superior over the other, they do not get along too well.<br/>Under a strict leadership the Destroyers prove quite competent in the area they are employed, which is usually to destroy things and to mash people. However, their true strength comes through quantity. Demons of higher ranks like to accumulate a horde of such minions and let them loose on a target. Such an unleashed horde of Destroyers is virtually  unstoppable. Having a seemingly endless supply on Destroyers, only the difficultly to enter the realms of the mortals keeps the demons from using them on a larger scale.</p>  <p>Destroyers have 3700 hitpoints. They are immune to energy damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth, fire and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Destroyers yield 2500 experience points. They carry burst arrows, crowbars, dark armors, demonic essence, gold coins, meat and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
