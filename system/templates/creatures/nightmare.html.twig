The gift of dreaming is only granted to mortals. Still some demons lurk at the borders of dreams, watching, drooling with hatred and greed. Sometimes a dreamer gets some distant feeling of those unwelcome spectators. Such dreams often turn into nightmares. The chaos and fear, that  is caused by nightmares, allow the lurking demons to steal some of the essence of these dreams. By eating more and more of this substance, demons gain certain characteristics which are normally not at disposal of demons. To some extent they are even able to haunt the dreams of the mortals, although their influence is only indirect and limited. Their physical form reflects their constant travel to a place they do not belong to and takes the shape of a ghostly horse creature. Their powers in the lands of the living are somewhat more substantial and often involve to weaken mortals and to steal their life force.</p>  <p>Nightmares have 2700 hitpoints. They are immune to death and earth damage. Moreover, they are strong against energy, fire and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Nightmares yield 2150 experience points. They carry concentrated demonic blood, demonic essence, essences of a bad dream, gold coins, ham, scythe legs, soul orbs and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
