Filled of what the gods opposing Zathroth and his allies would consider blasphemy and mockery of the godly order of things, these books have been given such a strong purpose that they unintentionally came to life. Burning not only with hell fire but also the desire to taint and burn everything that opposes Zathroth they are a common sight at places dedicated to him. The semi sentient books can't be controlled and so they are usually allowed to hover around, sniffing for all things that don't bear the mark of Zathroth. Sometimes, when a follower of Zathroth falls out of grace, they are the first to swarm him, attack him and ultimately incinerate him. Because of that faith trials are often held where many of the burning books made their lair. Though they technically intended with another, unknown sinister purpose, the sentience of the books had never stopped their production in the depth of hell. It is assumed that their production continues because they found their place and use despite being a failure. Other rumors though claim that only one burning masterbook was created at all and somewhere in the deepest, burning pits of hell this queen book still exists. Tended by an army of lower books, it spawns its burning breed with each beat of her burning heart.<br/>The burning books themselves are highly attuned to fire and wield it as shield and weapon. It is remorseless in its cruelty and eager to destroy anything that might displease Zathroth. How these animalistic creatures determine the dedication of others and how accurate they might be remains a secret. The cynical followers of Zathroth don't mind either and gleefully watch even the downfall of one of their own, when the books decide someone earned Zathroth' wrath.</p> <p>Burning Books have 18000 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage and cannot be paralysed. On the other hand, they are weak against ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Burning Books yield 11934 experience points. They carry book pages, demonic essence, flasks of demonic blood, magma coats, platinum coins, silken bookmarks and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
