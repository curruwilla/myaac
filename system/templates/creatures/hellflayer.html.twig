While other demons are known for their sheer strength and destructive power, Hellflayers are more dreaded and revered for their malicious cunning. Usually, they prefer to stay in the demon strongholds and spend their time plotting and scheming, although they seem to be involved with the spreading of certain spells which allow mortals to call them into their world. If they are summoned, it is usually a specific Hellflayer that can be called, and instead of being used as a help in battle, they are more prized as advisors and teachers of the dark arts. The reason for their eagerness to be summoned might be related to the fact that they often offer blood pacts to their summoners, and serve as emissaries of darker powers. Their offers are forbidden knowledge about artefacts, skills and spells, and their demands vary from seemingly harmless and easy deeds in their service to claiming parts of the summoner's soul. Hellflayers often keep close contact to their summoners and lure them deeper and deeper into their dark web. This is commonly known among summoners, but the appeal of the power and knowledge the Hellflayers offer has been hard to resist for many a curious mind. And while only the most foolish believe themselves to be the master of their summoned creature, in the end many fall victim to the hidden snares the Hellflayers add to their deals and pacts.<br/><br/>Hellflayers aren't free from vanity of their own, though. They tend to see themselves as somewhat of the demonic aristocracy, courting the various demon lords and princes with their services. Though generally more interested in corrupting and enthralling mortals, their arsenal of spells makes them a formidable opponent if they are forced to fight. Especially the places they call home are fiercely protected. But even then, they prefer to rely on other demons to take the beating, and readily sacrifice them for their own survival. </p>  <p>Hellflayers have 14000 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth, fire and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Hellflayers yield 12500 experience points. They carry concentrated demonic blood, demonic essence, gold coins, great mana potions, great spirit potions, pairs of hellflayer horns, platinum coins, small amethysts, small diamonds, small emeralds, small rubies, small topazes, ultimate health potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
