It is not bound to a certain habitat, so it can be encountered in caves, forests and ruins alike. Therefore it poses a threat everywhere but in the coldest or volcanic areas. It is aggressive and dangerous and it is not choosier in its diet than in its habitat. Anything is seen as prey and sometimes they even cannibalise creatures of their own species. Its poisonous fangs are more than enough to make these beasts a constant threat to the settlers but many extermination campaigns have driven them back from the centres of civilisation. Still the sight of a single Tarantula is usually enough for a town to hire some scouts and mercenaries to examine the area more closely.</p>  <p>Tarantulas have 225 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. Moreover, they are strong against energy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire and ice damage. It takes 485 mana to summon these creatures but they cannot be convinced.</p>  <p>Tarantulas yield 120 experience points. They carry gold coins, tarantula eggs and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
