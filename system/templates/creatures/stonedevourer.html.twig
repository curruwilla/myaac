The Stone Devourers have not been seen for centuries. Only recently have they resurfaced and sadly proven that the creatures the dwarfs encountered in the past were either a lesser variation or merely their juvenile forms. The true Stone Devourers are certainly more dangerous than those of the dwarven chronicles. They are underground dwellers displaying extreme aggressiveness and destructiveness. They often live in packs led by an alpha male. Oddly enough, the alpha seems to accept the submission of certain other races, which are then integrated into their packs. They are also alarmingly not territorial. Their packs wander the depths aimlessly, devouring and destroying everything in their way. The stone devourers are extremely resilient towards environmental conditions and seem not to mind to camp in areas that are extremely hazardous to other creatures. Therefore they often surprise wanderers who are familiar with the surroundings by attacking from unexpected places.</p>  <p>Stone Devourers have 4200 hitpoints. They are immune to earth and fire damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, energy, holy, ice and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Stone Devourers yield 2900 experience points. They carry ancient stones, coal, crystalline arrows, crystalline spikes, gold coins, great mana potions, mana potions, platinum coins, stone noses, strong health potions, strong mana potions, ultimate health potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
