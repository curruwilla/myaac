Not much is known about their agenda or where they have come from. The official brotherhoods of monks deny any knowledge about this special order. It is commonly assumed that Dark Monks serve some evil power since they react hostile to most people and attack them on sight. Their fighting style clearly indicates a training in martial arts and they even use a small array of spells of which some, like draining of life-force, point to a darker purpose of their order.</p>  <p>Dark Monks have 190 hitpoints. They are strong against death damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy and physical damage. It takes 480 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Dark Monks yield 145 experience points. They carry breads, dark rosaries, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
