Somehow a few of the creatures managed to sneak on ships and spread all over the world. Being mainly a scavenger, the Centipede rarely hunts actively for prey; but if it runs into a creature, it will attack it nonetheless. Given the fact that it does not have to kill for a living, the Centipede is astonishingly tough and challenging in combat. Being fast and poisonous, the Centipede can be quite dangerous, and its fertility causes its appearance in large numbers. This creature seems ineradicable, several extermination campaigns have already failed. Wherever a carrion is laying, a Centipede is close. However, it prefers to live in caves and narrow tunnels. Mould and decay seem to attract it and not little made their homes in the sewers of the cities.</p>  <p>Centipedes have 70 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. Moreover, they are strong against energy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. It takes 335 mana to summon these creatures but they cannot be convinced.</p>  <p>Centipedes yield 34 experience points. They carry centipede legs and gold coins with them.</p>  </div></div>
