Haunted by painful memories of unjust cruelties and an undeserved death they have suffered, they seek to drive out all living intruders, attacking and vengefully tearing at them while mourning their gloomy fate. Some adventurers believe that white shades are the remains of exceptional heroes and nobles of Drefia that cannot stand the dark summoners' presence in their once beautiful city, not even in death, and so are unable to rest in their graves.</p>  <p>White Shades have 260 hitpoints. They are immune to death and earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>White Shades yield 120 experience points. They rarely carry items with them.</p>  </div></div>
