Combined in prides they hunt other animals. In grim winters, they even come closer to towns to attack herds or humans. A single Wolf is a weak and shy opponent but as a pride they can be quite dangerous.</p>  <p>Wolves have 25 hitpoints. They are strong against holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and ice damage. It takes 255 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Wolves yield 18 experience points. They carry meat and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
