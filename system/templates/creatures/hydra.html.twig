Although probably not more intelligent than a beast, the Hydra has magical abilities. The breath of the Hydra is poisonous and it traditionally uses a forceful splash of hot water as a weapon. As dangerous as this might be, the true danger lies in the Hydra's incredible healing powers. Even severed heads grow back within a few heartbeats and each injury seems only to increase the creature's ravenous hunger. The Hydra seems to flourish in warm climate and usually build its lair close to greater bodies of water. Although the jungles climate seems to benefit their breeding, it is not uncommon to encounter small Hydra colonies in milder climate as well. Other than their dragon cousins, Hydras shun the dry heat. Hydras are not known to hoard treasures on purpose but having been on this earth for quite some time, and only randomly losing a fight, the belongings of their victims have started to fill up their caves.</p>  <p>Hydras have 2350 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against holy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Hydras yield 2100 experience points. They carry gold coins, ham, hydra heads, platinum coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
