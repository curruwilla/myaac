Amongst a flock of other hungry baby serpents, only the strongest survive the ferocious appetite of their siblings. While fighting for food with each other, they have to elude the occasional attacks of their uncaring parents. Quickly, the fight for survival becomes natural to the Young Sea Serpent. It's not such a surprise that Young Sea Serpents are aggressive and predatory. To reach the  immense size of an adult sea serpent, a Young Sea Serpent has to eat almost constantly. Always driven by hunger, they are often more daring and aggressive than adult serpents. Gladly they are too small to pose a threat to ships but they may attack small fisher boats.<br/><br/>They often follow fish schools to devour as much of them as they can. When doing so, it is not uncommon that they cross the path of a fisherman. Lucky are those who come out of such meetings with nothing worse than ruined nets. Often the ferocious attacks of the Young Sea Serpents capsize whole boats and the fishermen lose their catch and sometimes also their lives.<br/>Given their appetite and the aggressiveness of their species towards each other,  it is not astonishing that Young Sea Serpents often are loners. In the rare cases they stick together, they have hatched from the same nest and have established a strict hacking order that is necessary to avoid bloodshed and cannibalism.</p>  <p>Young Sea Serpents have 1050 hitpoints. They are immune to earth and ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against fire damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death, energy and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Young Sea Serpents yield 1000 experience points. They carry gold coins, morning stars and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
