They are independent, serving no master but their own malicious goals. As long as they can cause pain and fear to living beings, they are also prepared to ally with other evil entities. The nature of these possessive spirits is currently disputed. The most popular theory implies that the spirits are actually some ancient race that never had any corporeal form other than that of possessed undead beings. They cloak their possessed bodies with rags, and they arm them with a scythe imbued with part of their own mystical energy. These scythes are known to rend horrible wounds that heal only slowly and often become infected. The scythes are nearly indestructible and are able to cut through any armor with ease. The worst thing about the reapers is that they cannot be killed for good. Even if the undead body is hacked into pieces, the possessing spirit escapes unharmed, ready to possess another undead body. Some Grim Reapers haunt their opponents again and again until they finally kill them.<br/>Dread and fear are the things the spirits are looking for. It is assumed that the spirits feed on these emotions and also on pain and agony. For this reason, it is no surprise that Grim Reapers prefer places where they can inflict pain or fear.</p>  <p>Grim Reapers have 3900 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth, ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy, fire and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Grim Reapers yield 5500 experience points. They carry concentrated demonic blood, demonic essence, gold coins, great mana potions, scythes, ultimate health potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
