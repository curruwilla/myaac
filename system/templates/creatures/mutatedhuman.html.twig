Once humans, there is nothing left than pain and hatred. Their blurred minds rarely allow them planned actions. Their mutations were caused by contaminated material or magical radiation. In most cases, this has led to more or less slow and painful deaths, but in some cases the subjects managed to survive. If they retained some degree of sentience, they would rather wish to be dead, though. Due to the mutation, hardly anything of the original physiology is still intact, and sometime during the mutation process, the mind collapses in an act of self-defence. Having endured unimaginable conditions, the mutated bodies are highly resilient and extremely strong. Packs of Mutated Humans can easily dismantle whole neighbourhoods within a single night.<br/>Driven by animal-like instincts, the mutants often form packs in which the alpha mutant leads his brethren on hunts and raids. Mutated Humans usually hunt for food rather than for plunder. Still,  driven by old instincts, they tend to carry away everything they come across, only to drop it again a few minutes later, not even remembering what they had taken. Mutated Humans hardly ever use any weapons or tools, and only seldom they still wear the armor they were dressed in before their mutation took place.</p>  <p>Mutated Humans have 240 hitpoints. They are immune to death and earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Mutated Humans yield 150 experience points. They carry fishbones, gold coins, mutated flesh and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
