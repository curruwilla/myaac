The only thing that allows them to exist in the demonic society, that has no tolerance for weakness, is their cunning and the magical forces they have under their command. Diabolic Imps tend to be somewhat cowardly and when it comes to the crunch, they esteem the value of their own lives much higher than any agenda of the master they might serve. For this reason, they are not trusted and, despite their intelligence, rarely appointed to any position of power or influence. The scheming little Diabolic Imps still found their niche in the demon society. They often serve in logistics or as messengers. In the latter role, they are frequently sent to the realm of the mortals. Here they even pose as advisors of mortal allies of the demon kind for a while.</p>  <p>Diabolic Imps have 1950 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death and earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Diabolic Imps yield 2900 experience points. They carry blank runes, concentrated demonic blood, gold coins, pitchforks and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
