These factors combine to an extremely dangerous state of mind that often led to attacks on anything that enters their woods. Astonishingly enough, their attacks display not only an affinity to the element earth, but also to the element of air, as they instinctively use it to enhance their movement or more often to hinder that of their chosen foes.<br/>There are rare cases of reports that tell about good-natured withered leaf golems.
