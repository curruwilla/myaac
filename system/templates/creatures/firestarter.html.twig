When the elves realised what had happened, the temple was already fully ascended. Within a week after the event, most of the elves started to worship the forgotten god. But not all fell for this influence. A selected few rose against these blinded followers. When the elder god of the bog told the elves of Shadowthorn to capture all rioters, these insurgents started to sow what the lord of the bog hates most - fire. During the very short time this conflict lasted, both parties were about equal in both, strength and fanatism. In the end, the elf followers won the upper hand by an eyelash. The Firestartes were imprisoned in the dungeons beneath Shadowthorn. They are heavily guarded because the elves fear the Firestarters' wrath and the havoc they will surely wreak if ever released.</p>  <p>Firestarters have 180 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage. Moreover, they are strong against earth, holy and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Firestarters yield 80 experience points. They carry coal, flaming arrows, gold coins, grapes and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
