Being an insubstantial spirit, they roam the bogs and swamps, unable to leave them. Without noticing, their light often lures unsuspecting wanderers into the bog who mistake them for the lights of a nearby village. Wisps are rather timid and try to flee whenever a human is in sight. While trying to escape, they lure those unlucky souls deeper and deeper into the bog. In the treacherous swamps, such encounters can even end deadly.<br/>The light of Wisps is blinding and confusing if you look at it directly. They are quite fast, but whoever gets too close will experience that a Wisp's touch drains the life force from all living creatures. However, as they will always try to escape, they only pose a small threat to humans.</p>  <p>Wisps have 115 hitpoints. They are immune to death damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth, energy and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced.</p>  <p>Wisps yield 0 experience points. They rarely carry items with them.</p>  </div></div>
