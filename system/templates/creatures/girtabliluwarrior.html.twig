The reclusive creatures are a subspecies of the Anuma, magical beasts that inhabit the continent Kilmaresh and were created by the sun gods Suon and Fafnar.<br/><br/>It is said that the entire continent was once given to them by the gods. But the Anuma conferred the dominance over Kilmaresh to the humans, in an effort to let them take responsibility of their own. However, after the religious war between the worshippers of Suon and Fafnar and the cataclysm that severed the continent, the Anuma took the reign over Kilmaresh back - for the humans' own benefit as they said.<br/><br/>It is told that the girtablilu were first created by the sun god Suon in order to serve him and his sister Fafnar. They stood guard outside the gates of Suon's and Fafnar's temple high in the sky above Tibia, in a time when the divine siblings had not yet fallen out with each other. The scorpion men opened the doors for Suon and Fafnar as they traveled out each day, and closed the doors after them when they returned at night. They also protected the entrance the Land of Darkness. Ancient writings tell that their "terror is awesome" and their "glance is death". Nowadays they are guarding the sunken Ruins of Nuur against unwanted intruders.</p> <p>Girtablilu Warriors have 8500 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against death and earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Girtablilu Warriors yield 5800 experience points. They carry gold ingots, platinum coins, ultimate health potions and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
