They used their powers to gather this essence through their minions just like bees gather honey. Then they bound these disruptive powers into tangible shapes and added a little bit of demonic spirit. Filled with decay and a malicious will, the Blightwalkers were born. Whenever they find a way into the realms of the living, their steps are followed by death and decay. Everything fertile and healthy is considered as enemy and their dark instinct drives them to destroy and ruin everything they encounter. Even though demons often summon them as individuals to bring decay upon the ranks of their enemies, some enjoy to employ Blightwalkers as shock troops and footsoldiers of their armies.</p>  <p>Blightwalkers have 8900 hitpoints. They are immune to death and earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against energy, fire and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Blightwalkers yield 5850 experience points. They carry blank runes, bunches of wheat, bundles of cursed straw, demonic essence, gold coins, great mana potions, hailstorm rods, platinum coins, soul orbs, ultimate health potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
