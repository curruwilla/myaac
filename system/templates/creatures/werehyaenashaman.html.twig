At the beginning, the transformation only takes place at full moon, and the victim regains its human appearance the next morning. In the course of time, the transformation lasts longer and the full moon is no longer a necessary condition for the transformation. At a certain point, the beast takes over more and more often.<br/>Werehyaenas are sly and tough, yet not too strong or coordinated. They are predators as well as carrion eaters and their appearance is a mix between a hyaena and a human being. Like hyaenas, Werehyaenas favour warm savannas and deserts as homesteads and are aggressive and cunning.<br/>Other than Edron's and Cormaya's werebeasts, the werehyaena packs of the Darama Desert are known for having shamans in their ranks. They use simple bone talismans to cast spells that could somehow be connected to undead powers.<br/>The curse of the Full Moon, as it is frequently called, is usually spread by the infectious bite or scratch of other were-creatures. Forbidden books also tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a were-creature with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.</p> <p>Werehyaena Shamans have 2500 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against earth, fire and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Werehyaena Shamans yield 2200 experience points. They carry great mana potions, platinum coins, small amethysts, werehyaena noses and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
