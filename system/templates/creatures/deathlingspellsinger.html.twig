With their fish-like appearance but an upright walk, both share a lot of features. Their origin has not been sufficiently studied and they were a mere myth to the younger Njey. Spellsingers are versatile casters with an array of devastating spells. Compared with the weaker Njey siblings they are far more dangerous, even if faced alone. This old breed of spell-singing horrors has perfected their magic and enhances their powerful spells with ancient wisdom of the original Njey.</p> <p>Deathling Spellsingers have 7200 hitpoints. They are immune to fire and ice damage. Moreover, they are strong against death damage. On the other hand, they are weak against earth and energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Deathling Spellsingers yield 6400 experience points. They carry crystalline arrows, deepling filets, deeptags, platinum coins, small emeralds and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
