However, this scenario has become a shocking truth. Several forms of Slugs have been raised like cattle by various races such as the orcs and goblins since the dawn of time. It is questionable whether some of the prehistoric Slug rancher came up with the idea to breed some kind of battle Slugs or if some free roaming Slugs adapted to the constant danger by other races. It is quite likely that both effects went hand in hand. Anyhow, the Slug as we know it today was the result of this process. The Slug might not be a fearsome fighter but it has adapted to the constant threat to their race by developing resilience and an acid spitting capability that at least keeps their hunters somewhat at bay. Nevertheless, Slugs are still the favourite diet of several races and especially orcs consider Slug acid a spice.<br/>Most other giant Slug races are only known from orc and goblin myths since today's Slug successfully took over most habitats including even some from other races. This led to the incident known as the great Slug plague. In a rare and (unintentionally) combined effort of humans, dwarfs, elves, orcs, goblins and others, the Slugs were hunted, their eggs were destroyed where discovered, and poisoned traps were placed in their habitats. What most races, like the humans, conveniently left out in their history books is still known today among the goblin race as the 'Great Slug Wars'. The Slugs finally (and fittingly slowly) came back after the great purge, decimated, beaten, but not defeated. Slowly, the Slugs recovered and started to show up at unexpected places. Still, any greater Slug population often provokes attacks from Slug hunters. Also, still many races consider Slugs, their acid and their eggs a delicacy. For these reasons, greater populations have become uncommon.</p>  <p>Slugs have 255 hitpoints. They are strong against earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire, ice and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Slugs yield 70 experience points. They carry gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
