At the beginning, the transformation only takes place at full moon, and the victim regains its human appearance the next morning. In the course of time, the transformation lasts longer and the full moon is no longer a necessary condition for the transformation. At a certain point, the beast takes over more and more often.<br/>Werefoxes are quick and agile, yet not very strong or tough. They are predators and their appearance is a mix between a fox and a human being. Like foxes, Werefoxes favour subterranean caverns as homesteads and are sly and cunning.<br/>The curse of the Full Moon, as it is frequently called, is usually spread by the infectious bite or scratch of other were-creatures. Forbidden books also tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a were-creature with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.</p> <p>Werefoxes have 1500 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth, energy and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Werefoxes yield 1600 experience points. They carry fox paws, gold coins, platinum coins, werefox tails and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
