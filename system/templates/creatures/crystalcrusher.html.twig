It is not known by which means they can find cut gems or why they would specialise on a food resource that cannot to be found in nature. It is probable that this fondness is connected to crystal resonances and light reflection, though even the masters of these arts, the gnomes, cannot tell for sure how these factors influence the crystalcrushers' hunger or even their life cycles. On their constant search for new food, they often settle for other minerals in lack of greater amounts of cut gems. It seems that the crystals are used in the digestive system of the creature to pulverise other minerals. Given the Crystalcrusher's appetite, such digestive gems are used up quite fast which might explain its constant search for more gems and crystals. On their hunt they usually see everything either as food or competition for food and become quite dangerous.</p>  <p>Crystalcrushers have 570 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. Moreover, they are strong against death and fire damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy, holy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Crystalcrushers yield 500 experience points. They carry gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
