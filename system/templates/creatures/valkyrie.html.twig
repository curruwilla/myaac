They are even stronger in close combat and use their spears skilfully for distance fighting. Every amazon who has proven her bravery by taking the skulls of thirteen opponents will be promoted to a Valkyrie.</p>  <p>Valkyries have 190 hitpoints. They are strong against fire, holy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and physical damage. It takes 450 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Valkyries yield 85 experience points. They carry chain armors, gold coins, meat, spears and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
