Not only will they bite even heftier, they can actually swallow a person up in one nibble. They almost know no fear and seem to follow strange patterns and routines. Somehow these big maws have erected shrines for a probably non-existent god they worship as the "Overmaw". It is better to make short work of them as they are often surrounded by a pack of smaller guzzlemaws and wouldn't hesitate to call even more of them to join their fray.</p>  <p>Guzzlemaws have 6400 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth, energy, fire, ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Guzzlemaws yield 5500 experience points. They carry banana skins, bones, brown crystal splinters, crystal rubbish, fish tails, fishbones, frazzle skins, frazzle tongues, gold coins, great health potions, great mana potions, ham, pieces of iron, platinum coins, remains of a fish, skulls and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
