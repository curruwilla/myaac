Which is true for creatures like humans, is even more evident in the demon kind. In some of the demons the fire of hatred grows so strong that they are consumed by this inner, hellish fire. Some of them are powerful enough to fight back that urge for a while. They are equipped with hellish armors to contain the destructive energy that burns through them. They save their lives for the price of an existence in consuming and eternal pain, hatred and rage. Driven to the edge of madness and sometimes beyond, those demons love to release some of their anger and inner fire upon others. Exhaustive fight is their only way to find relief. The so-called Hellfire Fighters fight and destroy with everything that is left of their minds and consciousness in the ocean of rage and pain that had become their lives. Never expect a Hellfire Fighter to give in or to retreat. They will always fight to the bitter end.</p>  <p>Hellfire Fighters have 3800 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, energy and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Hellfire Fighters yield 3900 experience points. They carry blank runes, burnt scrolls, demonic essence, fiery hearts, gold coins, soul orbs and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
