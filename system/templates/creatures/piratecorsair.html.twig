They command their own ships and rule their crews with an iron hand. Of course, one has to pay the price for having so much power. A Pirate Corsair must always watch his back for vengeful or ambitious crewmen, or for attacks of other corsairs. To climb to such a position of power in a ruthless society like that of the pirates, one has to be remorseless, cunning and lethal.<br/>Everybody that had the chance to observe a Pirate Corsair in combat, knows that they did not obtain their position by chance. They are competent fighters that are often accompanied by some henchmen to lead a surprise attack on their unsuspecting opponents. They exploit any weakness of their enemies and use every dirty trick they are able to master. Their fighting skills are backed by their weapons and armor which are, of course, the best the pirates were able to loot during their many years of piracy.</p>  <p>Pirate Corsairs have 675 hitpoints. They are strong against earth and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death, fire and ice damage. It takes 775 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Pirate Corsairs yield 350 experience points. They carry compasses, gold coins, sabres and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
