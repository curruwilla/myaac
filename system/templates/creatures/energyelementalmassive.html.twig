They accumulate quite deadly and violent storms around them. They are strong and they are fast, and these are the most positive characteristics one can say about them. Massive Energy Elementals prey on every living being to chase and torment it. The Massive Energy Elemental is by far more malicious than its smaller cousin. It enjoys particularly the chase and often uses less power than it has on its disposal to extend the hunt.<br/>Massive Energy Elementals often ride on real storms and hurricanes and enjoy the damage and destruction they are causing. Facing a Massive Energy Elemental is like facing a storm itself. They also enjoy to occur in groups and to cause a large path of destruction. You can also see them in greater numbers right before a storm is forming. So it is not surprising that they have always been seen as an evil omen.</p>  <p>Massive Energy Elementals have 1100 hitpoints. They are immune to energy, fire and ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, holy and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against earth damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Massive Energy Elementals yield 950 experience points. They carry flash arrows, gold coins, strong mana potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
