Just like the frost dragons, the Crystal Spiders are also the results of a transformation, probably being descendants of Giant Spiders. However, the Crystal Spider was affected much more heavily than the frost dragon. Its body drastically changed to a crystalline or rather icy consistence, emitting an enormous cold. Its spiderwebs are not made of silk but of concentrated ice which is extremely cold. The cold alone is sufficient to freeze most creatures to the web which therefore does not need a gluey coating. The poison of the spider is like an injection of pure ice. It painfully freezes the flesh and numbs the extremities. The good resistance to cold that many creatures on the Ice Islands possess makes such advantage, however, redundant. For this reason, Crystal Spiders have specialised in hunting warm blooded creatures that are susceptible to their special abilities. This includes humans, elves and dwarfs. It is unknown if Crystal Spiders can survive in warmer climates. If they were able to adapt to warmer environment where much more prey is available that is susceptible to their attacks, they would easily spread through the lands like a plague.</p>  <p>Crystal Spiders have 1250 hitpoints. They are immune to fire and ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Crystal Spiders yield 900 experience points. They carry gold coins, plate armors, strong mana potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
