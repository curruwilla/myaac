They are generally benign, but at times, they may also display mischievous traits. Like most of the fae, pixies love dancing and are often gathering in larger groups to dance on secluded glades. Pixies are rather small, reaching about the height of a very young human child. They have pointed ears, colourful hair and fragile butterfly or dragonfly wings. These wings give them the ability to fly and a pixie's feet rarely touch the ground. Their clothing consists of fresh leaves and flower petals. Pixies love flowers, butterflies, shimmering beetles, gems and other colourful things as well as the taste of honey, sweetened oat and ripe grapes. Pixies emerge from mortals' dreams about friends and family.</p>  <p>Pixies have 770 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth and holy damage.
