From their earliest days, the purpose of the Deepling Guards lies in the protection of the temple cities and inner sanctums of God King Qjell. They are cunning hunters and powerful fighters with unmatched endurance, feared by even the fiercest creatures of Tibia's seas.</p>  <p>Deepling Guards have 1900 hitpoints. They are immune to fire and ice damage. Moreover, they are strong against death damage. On the other hand, they are weak against earth and energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Deepling Guards yield 2100 experience points. They carry deepling breaktime snacks, deepling guard belt buckles, eyes of a deepling, gold coins, great health potions, great mana potions, platinum coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
