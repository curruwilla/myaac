For a short while, they also comprised the largest group of the new enemies. However, this didn't last long and today only the most knowledgeable explorers still know about this fact.   <br/>In many regards the Dread Intruders are considered as pure embodiments of the new threat. They were the first creatures who have been captured by aspiring scientists. By examining this enemy, they learnt about the Dread Intruder's fleeting nature as well as the fact that this creature cannot exist very long without the support of a nearby destruction vortex. Dangerous and highly volatile, the Dread Intruder was even assumed to slightly bend reality itself. In-depth studies, however, revealed that this is rather an optical effect caused by the sheer load of destructive energy accumulated in these creatures. Still, it can't be denied that the laws of nature seem to be weakened by its very presence. Even if a certain degree of probability is applied, one cannot deny the countless reports about flickering lights, distorted sound, or objects that suddenly show minor damages or even changed properties whenever a Dread Intruder was around. For this reason, particularly priests claim that the existence of the Dread Intruder defiles reality the most.<br/>Despite these numerous assumptions and speculations, the Dread Intruder is a dangerous force to be reckoned with. Although its lack of conscience seems to be a weakness, the sheer power of the Dread Intruder makes up for that, and one is well-advised not to encounter this powerful opponent unprepared or in disadvantageous situations. Even without any sign of intelligence, the Dread Intruder shows a horrifying effectiveness in exploiting a foe's weakness. This ability can only be explained by the theory that claims that the Dread Intruder is an embodiment of greater destructive forces.</p>  <p>Dread Intruders have 4500 hitpoints. They are strong against death, energy, fire and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Dread Intruders yield 3000 experience points. They carry energy balls, energy bars, energy drinks, frozen lightning, gold coins, great mana potions, great spirit potions, instable proto matter, odd organs, platinum coins, ultimate health potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
