Infernalists are usually high-ranking followers of such cults that like to take things into their own hands. Instead of waiting for the apocalypse to come, they actively aim for their goal of total destruction.<br/>Though Infernalists used to be eager students of magic, they discarded a good deal of spells in their repertoire in favour of more destructive and flashy spell effects. It is surely not astonishing that their favourite element is fire, as these spells are not only highly destructive put also have some glamorous effects.<br/>Infernalists are easily won over for any task that causes destruction. They lack any form of patience though and often leave one job to join another. Several Infernalists work as mercenaries and some even find employment in armies. However, their short temper and their eagerness to start arguments about minor incidents make them bad employees. Even the cults they belong to are not very fond of them. For this reason, they are often sent on dangerous or even suicidal missions in the hope that they will never return. Despite all the destruction they have caused and enemies they have made, in the end, most Infernalists die either of their own machinations like destroying a building they are still in, or at the hands of allies that want to get rid of them.</p>  <p>Infernalists have 3650 hitpoints. They are immune to energy and fire damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against ice and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Infernalists yield 4000 experience points. They carry gold coins, great health potions, great mana potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
