The gravediggers are undead creatures that have first been sighted near the necromancer sites in Drefia, where they have at first been employed for strenuous handiworks such as digging and building up the underground ruins of Drefia. <br/>Some speculate that the hands were chopped off live subjects and then enhanced through hideous rituals and processes to take their actual, ghastly form. However, the beasts proved to have a will of their own and soon broke free from their masters' grip, and some still roam the premises like other undead. They are solitary creatures and quite aggressive, but a few cases have been reported where humans made friends with a gravedigger, which lasted a lifetime. </p>  <p>Gravediggers have 1500 hitpoints. They are immune to death, energy and ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. On the other hand, they are weak against earth, fire and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Gravediggers yield 950 experience points. They carry gold coins, platinum coins, unholy bones and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
