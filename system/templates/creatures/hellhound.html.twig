The Hellhound is one of those creatures. Being worse than beast or demon, it combines the most fearsome and most dangerous traits of both kinds to an amalgam of fearsome power. Containing the malice and ferocity of three demons, the Hellhound uses the malignant abilities of its three heads to cause as much damage as it can.<br/>Said to be three times meaner than the average hellbeast, its three heads are so frightening in their hellish rage that lesser men are said to have died already on sight of this walking menace of ichor and fangs. Sometimes one of these demon beasts is captured and trained by powerful demons to something that could be vaguely called a forced loyalty to their fearsome masters. As long as they respect their masters as the stronger one, they are relatively obedient. Still, nobody can tell when they might turn on their master or when they are driven into a frenzy that let them forget any bonds they might have shared. Hellhounds are known to get in such a rage that they not seldom heavily wound their own heads. Still large numbers of those beasts are bred and captured on order of several demonlords. They are as often employed to frighten an enemy or a rival as they are used as a status symbol to prove their might and disregard of danger ... and the lives of their other minions as well.</p>  <p>Hellhounds have 7500 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth and energy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Hellhounds yield 6800 experience points. They carry assassin stars, black pearls, blazing bones, concentrated demonic blood, demonic essence, fiery hearts, great mana potions, great spirit potions, ham, hardened bones, hellhound slobber, platinum coins, small emeralds, small rubies, small topazes, soul orbs, ultimate health potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
