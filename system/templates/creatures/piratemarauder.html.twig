Often already criminals before their career as a pirate, it is no big step for most of them to live a pirate's life. Lured by tales about freedom and treasuries, they become quickly disillusioned when facing reality.<br/>No better than a common bandit on land, Pirate Marauders care little for the health or the lives of others. Due to their living conditions they have turned into bitter and angry people who try to strike back at life by tormenting and suppressing others whenever possible. As weapons they use everything that they can purloin and loot and serves the purpose.Their agility makes up for their lack of armor. Fairly weak and cowardly, it is rather their number than their skill that might pose a threat.</p>  <p>Pirate Marauders have 210 hitpoints. They are strong against earth and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death, energy and fire damage. It takes 490 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Pirate Marauders yield 125 experience points. They carry compasses, gold coins, torches and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
