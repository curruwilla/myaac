They are formidable diggers and unsurpassed in agility by any other Corym. They are able to crawl through even the smallest and most twisted tunnels, and reach places where other Corym can not go. As opportunity makes thieves, other races consider the Charlatans to be the worst of thieves, but by other Corym, they are held in regard as daring heroes. Their campfire stories are full of the exploits of the Charlatans, and detail how they outsmarted and outran their enemies. In combat, the Charlatans like to fight dirty. What they lack in strength they make up for in agility, and their attacks are often aimed at vulnerable spots and accompanied by feints, to catch their opponents off guard. The more Charlatans are involved in a fight to overpower an enemy, the bolder their attacks. Although they generally tend to be rather cowardly, most Charlatans are so convinced of the superiority of the numerous talismans and fetishes they wear that they will not back away even from a fight with more powerful opponents; and the Corym believe that through their talismans, a kind of supernatural power is bestowed upon them as well. They fervently pose as healers, diviners and magicians, utterly trusting their charms and ignoring all facts that might contradict their conviction.<br/>Charlatans are usually the first to be encountered if Corym move into an area, and if a single Corym is encountered, it is usually a Charlatan. On the other hand, as a saying goes, for one Charlatan you see there are always two more in hiding, and indeed Charlatans generally travel in packs. The death rate of the Charlatans is incredibly high and only the immense reproduction rate of the Corym still keeps them in existence. Oddly enough, most Corym that are born are found suitable by the Skirmishers to belong to the Charlatans. This is even more true in times of war. The Corym see this as a sign of their gods' favour.</p>  <p>Corym Charlatans have 250 hitpoints. They are strong against death, earth and energy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. It takes 490 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Corym Charlatans yield 150 experience points. They carry cheese, gold coins, rat cheese, soft cheese and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
