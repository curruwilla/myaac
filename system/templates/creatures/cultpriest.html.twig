They usually work behind the scenes and are rarely encountered. If they appear, they fight with fervour and without remorse. They command all other cultists and would never risk facing an opponent alone. Their magical powers are immense. Equipped with expensive armor and weapons, they are a lethal threat to everyone that tries to uncover the secrets of the cult. No Enlightened would ever betray their cult.

In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Enlighteneds Of The Cult yield 500 experience points. They carry cultish masks, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
