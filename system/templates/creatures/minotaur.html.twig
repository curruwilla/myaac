They live in great caves where they even build proper towns. Furthermore, they arrange troops that repel every intruder from their empire. Minotaurs are average fighters, but organised as a military squad they can be quite dangerous.</p>  <p>Minotaurs have 100 hitpoints. They are strong against fire and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and ice damage. It takes 330 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Minotaurs yield 50 experience points. They carry chain armors, gold coins, maces, plate shields and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
