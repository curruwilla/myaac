Although plant-like in its looks and structure, it seems to be able to control its movements. It is carnivorous by nature and follows almost mindlessly its greedy appetite. Its poisonous attacks decelerate its victims and so the slow giant plant can catch up and attack with its thorny tentacles and a maw-like blossom. The dead bodies of their victims do not only serve as food but also as fertiliser for the plants seeds. Therefore it is advised to burn bodies who died by an attack of a Carniphila.</p>  <p>Carniphilas have 255 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. Moreover, they are strong against energy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Carniphilas yield 150 experience points. They carry gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
