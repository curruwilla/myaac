They are very strong, and live on blood which they suck out of their victims. Dressed with long capes, which are black as night, they are hunting in the dungeons and, at night, even on the surface. Some people actually believe that they are able to fly, like bats which look like small vampires. Their scaring sight and their bloodcurdling cries have already paralysed many brave adventurers.</p>  <p>Vampires have 475 hitpoints. They are immune to death and earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Vampires yield 305 experience points. They carry gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
