Their main goal being the fall of king Kesar, they are trying everything in their might to breach the old walls of the castle. Shamefully disregarding the very life and well-being of its inhabitants. The usurper commanders are battle-hardened veterans who guide their subordinates with wits and an iron fist.</p> <p>Usurper Commanders have 8500 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against holy and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Usurper Commanders yield 7200 experience points. They carry axes, fur shreds, lion cloak patches, platinum coins and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
