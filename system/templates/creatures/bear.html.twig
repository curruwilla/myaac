They are pacific animals, but they can get quite aggressive when you enter their habitat. Their stroke can be very strong, but as Bears are slow you should be able to flee. It is recommended to attack Bears with distance fighting weapons.</p>  <p>Bears have 80 hitpoints. They are strong against holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and ice damage. It takes 300 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Bears yield 23 experience points. They carry ham, meat and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
