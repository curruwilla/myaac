To some extent this plant is a sentient being that attacks everything that approaches it. Most jungle dwellers seem to have developed some strategy to coexist with that plant. Outsiders however are immediately attacked with poisonous thorns that the nettle spits from a sack beneath its blossoms. It seems it has an endless supply of thorns and we have not heard yet of a nettle that has run out of them. It is not quite clear why a plant would attack in such a manner, but most likely it is some sort of self-defence that is unparalleled in the plant world. The lizard people have cultivated that plant to defend their dwellings. So utmost caution is advised when you encounter a colony of those plants, some angry 'gardener' could be just around the corner.</p>  <p>Spit Nettles have 150 hitpoints. They are immune to earth and energy damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Spit Nettles yield 20 experience points. They carry gold coins, nettle spit, shadow herbs and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
