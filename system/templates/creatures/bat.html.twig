Being little stronger than a rat, they are rather a nuisance than a threat to an experienced adventurer. Their diet usually consists of small animals and their rare attacks on people mainly happen out of self-defence. Bats often form large swarms, and it is slightly more dangerous to face such a swarm than a single exemplar. Bats can be found almost everywhere as long as there is some dark place close-by where they can breed and sleep.</p>  <p>Bats have 30 hitpoints. They are weak against earth damage. It takes 250 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Bats yield 10 experience points. They rarely carry items with them.</p>  </div></div>
