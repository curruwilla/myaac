They are astonishing agile when they are catching their prey though, and many were misled by their otherwise slow motions. The strength of their jaws is incredible and they hunt animals much larger than themselves with ease. For hours they can wait motionlessly for the unwary to approach and then to strike at complete surprise. If they manage to catch some mammal in water, there is almost no escape. On land, their claws and their thick scale skin makes it an impressive fighter and a threat to everything alive. You are advised to stay away from shores or to go there only with utmost caution.</p>  <p>Crocodiles have 105 hitpoints. They are strong against earth and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy, fire and physical damage. It takes 350 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Crocodiles yield 40 experience points. They carry gold coins, ham, pieces of crocodile leather and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
