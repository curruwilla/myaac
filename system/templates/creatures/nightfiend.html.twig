They arrived in Drefia in the wake of the vampire nobles, and they seem to be the fiercer cousins of the manbats, but darker, stronger and even more vicious. <br/>Some surmise that the nightfiend might be the result of strange experiments with vicious manbats in Drefia, where both species have first been sighted. Some speculate that they are a sort of bodyguard or pet for the vampire nobles that reside there, but considering the nightfiends' strength, the latter seems unlikely. <br/>In any case, nightfiends are fierce fighters that will be aided by manbats if attacked. The first man to see a nightfiend was the only survivor of a large exploration party searching for a lost artefact, and barely made it out in one piece.</p>  <p>Nightfiends have 2700 hitpoints. They are immune to death and earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against energy, ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Nightfiends yield 2100 experience points. They carry gold coins, platinum coins, vampire teeth and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
