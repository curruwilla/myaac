A once honourable and revered order of knights. They fell victim to a curse centuries ago and are now mere shadows of their former, noble self. The mighty knights are expertly trained and can prove an unsurmountable obstacle in combat. These relentless warriors are still bound to their oaths and will defend the order to the death.</p> <p>Falcon Knights have 9000 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against death and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Falcon Knights yield 5985 experience points. They carry assassin stars, flasks of demonic blood, great health potions, great mana potions, ham, onyx arrows, small amethysts, small diamonds, small emeralds, small rubies, soul orbs and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
