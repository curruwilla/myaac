Exposed to a dark ritual at birth, they unwillingly abandoned their former lives to morph into tree-like shadow beings. Some time after coming of age they wander away to fall into a neverending slumber deep underground. Standing in pitch-black darkness, sleeping still, dreaming quaint dreams of death they await the time of joint uprising. Some are born to be chosen custodians of their siblings, awake and sentient.<br/><br/>Due to a curse, they have undergone an incomplete metamorphosis and remain human. Their extreme determination and will to defend the Forest of Life, for example, stems from the fact that they deeply feel the need of all their siblings and will fight, if blindly, for their survival. Mumbling and full of aggressiveness. They can be described as deformed humans, connected to a complex hive mind.<br/><br/>Dark carnisylvans are tainted by corrupted magic and try to enchant their victims with bizarre spells. It is not easy to escape the clutches of a dark carnisylvan as most of its spells are also instantly affecting the mind.</p> <p>Dark Carnisylvans have 7500 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against death and earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Dark Carnisylvans yield 4400 experience points. They carry bones, carnisylvan bark, carnisylvan finger, platinum coins and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
