They live together in prides and are dangerous predators, because they are very quick and try to kill their prey with a single bite. The lion is a popular symbol of royalty as well as of courage and bravery. <br/><br/>The Noble Lion is the undoubted king among his lesser siblings. Among with the already impressive Roaring Lions the majestic and powerful Noble Lions dwell in caves and ruins rather than in the desert.They are the biggest and strongest type of lions, also varying in appearance and behavior. Their fur has a golden shimmer and their eyes remind of radiant emeralds. Also they act in a more intelligent way when preying and therefore are more dangerous than the customary lion. Some sages think the Noble Lions are a sort of mystical beings from olden times because they are so often found in the ruins of ancient sanctuaries or buried temples. Whether they are the wardens of these sacred sites or were themselves a subject of worship is a secret that has still to be revealed. As far as is known they sometimes allow particularly worthy heroes to ride them into battle. </p>  <p>Noble Lions have 1000 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed.
